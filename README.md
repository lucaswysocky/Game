### Project description

A simple arcade game developed using pygame.


### Objective

Practice programming in Python (especially code refactoring skills) and build something fun while at it!


### Libraries

* pygame

### More info

Player has to shoot as many aliens as possible and try to beat the highest recorded score. The game starts with a play button. Player controls the spaceship using the left and right arrow keys and shoots laser bullets using the space button.
There can be up to 5 laser bullets flying in the field, so be wise about where and how often you shoot!  
Run *Project_1.py* to start the game.

After shooting all the aliens, user advances to the next level. This increases spaceship's agility!

However, with each new level, the aliens approach faster and faster!

There are 3 lives per game. If aliens hit the bottom of the screen or the spaceship, the user looses a life.

The file *settings.py* controls all the game's parameters, including how more difficult each level is, how agile the spaceship becomes etc.
The highest score is kept, try to beat if you fell you can do it!


### Future improvements

* aliens shooting their own laser bullets
* obstacles the aliens can hide behind
* more nuanced movements the aliens can make
